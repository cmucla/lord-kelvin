  <h1>Lord Kelvin</h1>
  <h2>William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin</h2>
  <p>William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, OM, GCVO, PC, FRS, FRSE (/ˈkɛlvɪn/; 26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish[1][2] mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the mariner's compass, which had previously been limited in reliability.
